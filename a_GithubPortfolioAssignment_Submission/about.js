//<p class="text">My name is Justin and I am an aspiring software engineer! I most recently completed an MBA from the NYU Stern School of Business and worked in Investment Banking for three years advising techology, media and telecom companies. I realized pretty early on, closely observing some of the most successful software businesses in the SaaS space, that those whom where the best operators were business experts first and financial specialists second! So I decided to leave my Investment Banking role, and before I did anything else, choose to pursue a career in software engineering! </p>
